## Udacity - Descriptive Statistics Project

This is the final Project for the Descriptive Statistics Course at Udacity. It is done for free and hence not reviewed by Udacity. I would love to receive feedback on this project which would help to improve my understanding about the project.

### Project Overview

This project is done by conducting an experiment dealing with drawing from a deck of playing cards and contains my findings about it. A sample for the dataset in the experiment is obtained by drawing three cards at a time from a deck of playing cards without replacement. This sampling procedure is repeated a total of thousand times to get the dataset of size 1000. A python script was created to perform the given experiment.
